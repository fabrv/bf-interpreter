# How to contribute
Hello 🙌! Thanks for taking the time to read this and hopefully you are interested in contributing to the project.
There are no particular long term ideas or tasks to do so any contribution is welcomed.
There are 3 main ways to contribute:
1. 🐜 Reporting bug/issues
2. 🔥 Request features
3. 💡 Submit any change you deem fun, resonable or worth adding to the project

# Styleguide
If you want to contribute through code changes then send the pull request with a clear list of the changes you've made and make sure those changes adhere to the [Standard Javascript Style](https://standardjs.com/). Since all of the code is done in Typescript I highly recommend using the [Standard Typescript Linter](https://github.com/standard/standard#can-i-use-a-javascript-language-variant-like-flow-or-typescript).  
Other recommendations (things I like but don't really matter too much):
* 💬 Add comments every few lines of code explaining what you are doing.
* 😠 Use Arrow Functions instead of callbacks or god forbid function expressions.
* 🔡 Use types in every variable.

(And obviously any and every change or addition must be in Typescript)
